        <h2>Why you should start with golf</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <h3>Dont become a range rat</h3>
            This is actually great advice. Always remember that while the
            driving range is great practice, don’t get too comfortable there.
            Don’t be afraid to hit the course!
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>Taking lessons is worth the money</h3>
            Equipment upgrades are great and necessary, but sometimes, rather
            than spending $100+ on yet another item, spending that money on a
            lesson can pay big dividends.
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>Taking lessons is worth the money</h3>
            Starting with short chip shots, when you’re an ultra newcomer, can
            be helpful in learning the basic (and most important) foundation of
            the golf swing: Learning how to put the clubface on the golf ball.
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>Master your grip</h3>
            Starting with a good grip, like you see above, is so important. A
            bad grip can cause so many issues in your golf swing.
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>Get “fitted” for clubs</h3>
            You don’t need to get fit right away, but once you start to get
            serious, poorly-fit clubs can cause long-term issues in your golf
            swing.
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>Keep your head down on putts</h3>
            Get used to listening to the ball go into the hole without
            necessarily looking up to see it drop.
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>Aim for the center of the green and not the flags</h3>
            It’s true for the pros, and it’s true for beginners, too.
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>Have a short memory</h3>
            Bad shots will come. They’ll come often. That’s just golf. Don’t
            take them too seriously and don’t dwell on them. Get a few lessons.
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>Play fast and don’t lose your temper</h3>
            Most golfers don’t care how good you are at the game. You can be a
            great golfer and a fun golfer to play around with. Keep your temper
            under control and play fast. Then you’ll be a joy to play with.
