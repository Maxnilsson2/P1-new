            <h2>St Andrews</h2>
            <p>
              The Old Course at St. Andrews is ground zero for all golf
              architecture. Every course designed since has either been in
              response to one or more of its features, or in reaction against
              it. Architects either favor the Old Course's blind shots or detest
              them, either embrace St. Andrews' enormous greens or consider them
              a waste of turf. Latest polarizing topic: Martin Hawtree's design
              changes in advance of the 2015 Open Championship, which many
              considered blasphemy beforehand. After Zach Johnson's dramatic
              overtime victory, few mentioned the alterations. Weâ€™ll see how the
              latest (minor) alterations play out when the historic links hosts
              the 150th Open Championship in July. <br /><br />

              The course was formerly a plant nursery, and each hole on the
              course is named after the tree or shrub with which it has become
              associated. Several of the holes on the first nine have been
              renamed, as well as hole 9, he golf course architecture website
              GolfClubAtlas.com has said, "Augusta National has gone through
              more changes since its inception than any of the world's twenty or
              so greatest courses. <br /><br />

            <p>
              On a clear spring day, with Dundrum Bay to the east, the Mountains
              of Mourne to the south and gorse-covered dunes in golden bloom,
              there is no lovelier place in golf. The design is attributed to
              Old Tom Morris but was refined by half a dozen architects in the
              past 120 years, most recently by Donald Steel. Though the greens
              are surprisingly flat, as if to compensate for the rugged terrain
              and numerous blind shots, bunkers are a definite highlight, most
              with arched eyebrows of dense marram grasses and impenetrable
              clumps of heather.
