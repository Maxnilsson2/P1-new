            <h2>Bag</h2>
            <p>
              You do need a bag to enjoy a game of golf, in fact, most clubs
              will not let you on the course without a bag of your own. They are
              designed for the job and will protect your clubs during your
              rounds. There are different golf bags, so it is vital to identify
              the right one for your needs. Key factors include the number of
              clubs you want to carry, the type of course, the amount you play,
              whether you walk or ride on a cart and any other items you might
              want to take with you.

            <h2>Driver</h2>
            <p>
              One of the most important and sought after golf clubs is the golf
              driver. The golf driver is what most golfers start each hole with
              and having the right driver for your round can set you up for
              success. The golf driver is the largest golf club in the bag and
              is meant for driving the golf ball long distances off the tee.
              Drivers have enlarged club heads allowing you to tee the ball high
              up from the ground to give maximum height and distance off the
              tee. The golf driver allows you to reach the hole in less strokes
              because of the enormous distance it can provide in just one stroke

            <h2>Ironclubs</h2>
            <p>
              shots will come from the fairway. Irons are designed with divots
              in mind. That's why they have a leading edge that is somewhat
              sharply rounded. If you take a shot with an iron and dig up a
              chunk of turf, don't feel bad. Maybe you dug up too much turf
              (which is called a fat shot), but it is entirely appropriate to
              take a divot with an iron played from the fairway.

            <h2>Woods</h2>
            <p>
              We find many names for the things we love. Woods, fairway woods
              and metal woods – they’re all exactly the same thing even though
              their called different names. But we still find that fairway wood
              is the most widely accepted name. A fairway wood is a driver in
              miniature. It has higher loft than a driver, a smaller head and a
              shorter shaft. Overall this makes it easier to hit the centre of
              the face and this categorises it as more forgiving. It doesn’t go
              as far as a driver but sometimes it’s just more important to be
              straight than long. The club has a variety of uses and can also be
              used for your tee shot on a tight and short par 4. It can also
              help you reach the green on long par 5s.

            <h2>Wedges</h2>
            <p>
              On the course, players face many situations where the issue at
              hand isn’t shooting long distances but making short, accurate
              shots. Whether chipping, pitching, or lobbing, a golf wedge is
              best for short approach shots. Knowing how to assess each
              situation and decide which club will give you the most significant
              advantage is the difference between the amateurs and seasoned
              players.

            <h2>Putter</h2>
            <p>
              A putter is the type of club a golfer will normally use to finally
              hit the ball into the cup on every hole. The face of the club is
              flat (or close to) and it is designed to get the ball rolling
              forward rather than lift it from the ground and take flight.
              Traditionally the putter was the shortest club in a golfer’s bag
