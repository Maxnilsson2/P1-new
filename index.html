        <h2>Why you should start with golf</h2>

              >Anyone has the potential to learn the game. You can learn to play
              golf if you are physically capable of swinging a golf club. If you
              decide to start playing golf, find a golf coach and learning
              program near you to help you get a solid foundation in the game.
              Do not be a do-it-yourselfer! Renovating a bathroom is a
              do-it-yourself project. Golf is an activity where a good golf
              coach can be a lifesaver to your new hobby.</em

              >Golfers live longer! A Swedish study suggests that golfers can
              expect to live five years longer than the average person. In
              another interesting analysis of Champions Tour players, the life
              expectancy of these players is 87 years, while the US male life
              expectancy is 76 years. Finally, research has found that
              low-handicap golfers live longer than any other golfer! What does
              this all imply? To be a low handicap golfer or reach the highest
              skill level of a Champions Tour player, you must play a lot of
              golf! The more golf you play, the longer you will live…so says the
              research!</em

              >Golf is for you if you like spending time outdoors with mother
              nature. Mark Twain once wrote, “Golf is a good walk spoiled.”
              Twain must not have been able to appreciate nature while searching
              for his lost golf ball in the woods. As for me, I have seen all
              kinds of wildlife on golf courses that can make the golf
              experience even better. There is also an amazing variety of golf
              course topography and ecosystems that only nature can create.
              Mother Nature is undoubtedly the best artist, and with golf, you
              can experience a wide array of her paintings.</em

              >The social benefits of the game transcend into new relationships
              with fellow golfers. Golf is also a business sport where
              relationships with vendors and strategic partners can be developed
              and nurtured while on the links. A golf course is a beautiful
              venue for a business meeting where you can share a great
              experience with clients and partners.</em

              >Golf is the perfect sport to get the family together and play a
              weekly round of golf. An afternoon round of golf followed by a
              nice family dinner…better than Thanksgiving.

              >Unlike many sports we are introduced to early in life, such as
              baseball, softball, basketball, football, and track and field,
              golf can be played until the very end! Golf is a low-impact sport,
              so the game can be enjoyed at any age. The National Golf
              Foundation studied avid junior golfers who played 25 times a year.
              By the time these golfers reached 55, the research had revealed
              that 100% of these junior golfers were still playing golf. If you
              get addicted to the game at a young age…there is no cure for
              quitting the game. You will play for the remainder of your
              life!</em

              >There is growing evidence that golf can improve your overall
              mental health. Dr. Jacquelyn Turner from Morehouse School of
              Medicine said that research shows that golf releases hormones that
              reduce stress and anxiety. In a nation where Americans are
              bombarded with electronic stimuli, golf gives you a chance to
              unplug from a fast-paced lifestyle and recharge your mental
              batteries.</em

              >Hall of Fame golfer Arnold Palmer said it best, “Golf is
              deceptively simple, yet endlessly complicated.” Golf seems simple
              when you play well, but it can become very complicated when you
              struggle. Golf is a physical and mental challenge for those that
              want to play well. However, plenty of golfers enjoy the game’s
              challenge without making it a complicated and frustrating
              endeavor.</em

              >There is no evidence to suggest that better golfers have more fun
              playing the game than less skilled golfers. There are many ways to
              have fun playing the game. One of the most enjoyable ways to play
              is one that golfers fail to implement. Simply play golf without
              keeping score! Unless you play in a competition, there is no rule
              requiring you to keep a score. To participate in organized golf
              tournaments, you must establish an official handicap. An official
              handicap requires you to record your scores into a handicap
              system.</em

              >There are over 15,000 golf courses in America. Each one offers
              golfers a diverse level of challenge, aesthetics, climate, design
              features, and overall experience. No two golf courses are the
              same! This allows golfers to travel around the country to enjoy
              new destinations and golf courses. There is no other sport quite
              like golf regarding variety and unique experiences!</em

        <br />
        “Golf is a compromise between what your ego wants you to do, what
